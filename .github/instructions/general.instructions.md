This is a mobile-first language learning app for Arabic, designed to help users practice and improve their language skills through interactive exercises and quizzes. The app features a user-friendly interface with a focus on engaging learning experiences.

The desktop experience is basically a mobile screen scaled up.

we illustrate the tasks with AI generated images, using a Studio-Ghibli anime style. We are a Saudi based app, so things sometimes have a touch of arab or saudi culture. People figuring in the images wear traditional Saudi attire.

Facial features are not visible in the images, as we want to keep the focus on the learning content rather than individual identities. The images should be colorful and appealing, enhancing the overall aesthetic of the app.

We should be inspired by other mainstream language learning apps. The design should be clean, modern, and intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate through lessons and exercises.

The main theme colors are #4A90E2 (blue) and #F5A623 (orange), which should be used consistently throughout the app for buttons, highlights, and other interactive elements. The background should be light to ensure readability and a pleasant user experience.

We use Preact and Tailwind.
